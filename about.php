                    <h3>Sales Philosophy</h3>
                    <p class="">
                        Our mission is simple: to make it easy for SaaS and software firms to acquire new customers at scale, with predictable consistency. There’s nothing I enjoy more than hearing the sales bell ring DING DING! I’ve always been fascinated by top-performing sales reps, which led me to leave a top 5 consulting firm after graduating from University College London (UCL) and join a leading startup during the dot.com era. Selling is tough, and through experience, I realized that the best sales professionals weren’t just the hardest workers, nor were they merely lucky. It became my mission to crack the code to consistent sales success – and I did.

                    <h3>The Power of Sales Coaching</h3>
                    <p>
                        Did you know that The Sales Management Association reports that sales coaching ranks as the #1 activity impacting sales effectiveness, but only 15% of managers feel they provide adequate coaching? In fact, 94% of sales reps who receive exceptional coaching hit their quotas. I was fortunate to be coached and mentored by some of the best consultative software sellers at BMC Software and GE, which was a turning point in my career. Now, I want to help individual sales reps, sales leaders, and founder/CEOs experience similar success and become catalysts for hypergrowth.

                    <p>
                    With over 14 years of experience, I’ve helped scale SaaS and enterprise software sales teams across multiple regions, closing over $22 million in sales. I’ve played a key role in helping startups achieve successful exits, and during the COVID pandemic, I coached a team that continues to close over 300 deals per month.
