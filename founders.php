                                            In the fiercely competitive UK SaaS ConTech sector, a sustainability-focused startup urgently needed to secure Series A funding to extend their cash runway and drive growth.

                                            We rapidly designed a dynamic go-to-market strategy to boost investor confidence by identifying the Total Addressable Market (TAM) and focusing on five key Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs). Our approach included creating ICO belief systems, refining offer strategies, and crafting distinct buyer journeys for both transactional and consultative sales.

                                            Operational enhancements involved an overhaul of the HubSpot CRM, recruiting and onboarding new team members across Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success, implementing a new sales compensation plan, and introducing a fresh sales and marketing tech stack. generating over 90 top-of-funnel MQLs. We also trained the sales team in the MEDDPICC methodology

                                            Our efforts swiftly renewed all at-risk contracts and escalated MRR from £27k to £106k in just 7 months, halving the sales cycle to 3 months. Key achievements included securing a £1.2M enterprise deal and other contracts worth over £400k TCV, enhancing pipeline accuracy and reporting. This led to Qflow securing $9.1M in Series A funding, positioning the company for sustained growth in the UK, US, and Middle East.
