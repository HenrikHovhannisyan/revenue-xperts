                                            Our efforts swiftly renewed all at-risk contracts and escalated MRR from £27k to £106k in just 7 months, halving the sales cycle to 3 months. Key achievements included securing a £1.2M enterprise deal and other contracts worth over £400k TCV, enhancing pipeline accuracy and reporting. This led to Qflow securing $9.1M in Series A funding, positioning the company for sustained growth in the UK, US, and Middle East.

                                            In the fiercely competitive UK SaaS ConTech sector, a sustainability-focused startup urgently needed to secure Series A funding to extend their cash runway and drive growth. With over half of their MRR at risk of churn within six months, the stakes were high.

Our approach included creating ICO belief systems, refining offer strategies, and crafting distinct buyer journeys for both transactional and consultative sales.
