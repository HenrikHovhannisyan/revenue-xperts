                        There are many situations where going out and paying an executive recruiter to find a great CRO or VP of Sales does not suit your company at this point in time. I only select a handful of carefully selected companies to work with each per year which allows me to partner with Founders, CEOs and CROs who want to be freed up from the stress of sales and desire rapid transformative results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I will develop and execute the go-to-market strategy,  build scalable processes and actually work side-by-side with you and your leadership team and existing sellers to manage the revenue function until we see some predictability in net-new sales. I will get you on the road to hitting MRR and ARR targets with sellers who are consistent high performers. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        You can choose one of my three tried and tested engagement plans or I can build a bespoke program for your based on your specific priorities, weaknesses and gaps in your current team.

                        Hiring me as a fractional GTM Advisor or CRO allows for a quick and immediate impact on your sales function. Unlike the time-consuming process of recruiting a permanent CRO or VP Sales, I am resourcefully onboarded rapidly and start making an immediate contribution to sales performance and revenue generation.

I will optimize sales processes, develop the sales team, and drive revenue generation during periods of expansion. The level of pipeline visibility, transparency and accuracy I will ensure within 90-days will prove incisive. This reliable view of your revenue performance will fuel strategic decision making as you grow your business.                             </li>

                        The Middle East region  presents an outstanding opportunity for UK and US B2B SaaS and tech firms looking to expand into emerging markets to drive hypergrowth. This region not only offers the potential to boost MRR and ARR but also significantly enhance market capitalization, enhancing a company’s attractiveness to investors and attentive acquisitive companies. With its robust economic growth, substantial investment in technology, and a less saturated market, the Middle East is ripe for UK and US SaaS solutions that can capitalize on the region’s economic climate, less saturated market segments and generally enthusiastic appetite for B2B SaaS and technology.

                                <strong>High Growth Potential:</strong> The UAE and Saudi Arabia are implementing ambitious economic plans, such as Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to increase the non-oil industry's contribution to GDP significantly. This transformation signals great growth potential for tech firms.

                                <strong>First-Mover Advantage:</strong> The Middle Eastern market for SaaS products is less saturated compared to Western markets. By entering early, UK and US firms can establish strong brand presence and loyalty before the competition intensifies.

                                <strong>Government Incentives and Support:</strong> Many Middle Eastern governments offer incentives to attract tech firms, including tax exemptions, subsidies, and funding for technology projects.

                                            We rapidly designed a dynamic go-to-market strategy to boost investor confidence by identifying the Total Addressable Market (TAM) and focusing on five key Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs). Our approach included creating ICO belief systems, refining offer strategies, and crafting distinct buyer journeys for both transactional and consultative sales.

                                            Operational enhancements involved an overhaul of the HubSpot CRM, recruiting and onboarding new team members across Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success, implementing a new sales compensation plan, and introducing a fresh sales and marketing tech stack. generating over 90 top-of-funnel MQLs. We also trained the sales team in the MEDDPICC methodology

                                            Our efforts swiftly renewed all at-risk contracts and escalated MRR from £27k to £106k in just 7 months, halving the sales cycle to 3 months. Key achievements included securing a £1.2M enterprise deal and other contracts worth over £400k TCV, enhancing pipeline accuracy and reporting. This led to Qflow securing $9.1M in Series A funding, positioning the company for sustained growth in the UK, US, and Middle East.
